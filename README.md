# üè• Predictive Modelling in Healthcare using ML and DL Techniques

This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict healthcare outcomes. Predictive analytics in healthcare can assist in early disease detection, personalized treatment planning, and reducing hospital readmission rates.

## üìÅ Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering on medical records
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and outliers
- Application of machine learning algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Deep learning models:
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
  - Keras/TensorFlow-based models
- Evaluation of models using accuracy, AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, and other metrics

## üß™ Dataset

The dataset contains healthcare-related records (e.g. patient information, vitals, diagnoses, treatment outcomes). Features may include:
- Age, gender, vital signs
- Lab results
- Diagnosis codes
- Outcome labels (e.g. disease/no disease, readmitted/not readmitted)

**(Replace with your dataset source if known)**  
Example: Public datasets like [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.mit.edu/), UCI ML Repository, or synthetic data.

## üíª Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras, TensorFlow
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìä Results

The final models demonstrated strong predictive power, with deep learning models offering improved performance on complex patterns. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and model tuning in healthcare analytics.
